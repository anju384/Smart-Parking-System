# Smart Parking Management System

A Python-based smart parking management system prototype using QR-based slot selection and real-time visualization.

## Overview
This project was developed as a college project to demonstrate how software-based automation can be applied to indoor parking management systems.  
It focuses on digital slot management, QR-based entry/exit flow, and real-time status updates.

## Features
- QR-based parking slot selection
- Real-time visualization of available and occupied slots
- Entry and exit simulation using unique verification codes
- User and admin interaction through a web interface

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- QR Code Library
- HTML, CSS
- OpenCV (conceptual)

## System Design
The system follows a simple client-server model:
- Users register and select parking slots via a web interface
- Each booking generates a unique QR code
- Slot status updates dynamically during entry and exit

## Note
This project is a **software-based simulation** created for academic purposes.  
Object detection and hardware-based verification are kept **conceptual** and can be integrated in future versions.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of real-time object detection
- Hardware sensors for slot occupancy
- Database optimization and analytics
